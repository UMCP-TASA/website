Hi, i'm TASA's maniacal computer junkie and 2nd year Computer Science major and Physics minor! Who better to manage our online image than someone who doesn't sleep, spends all day on his computer or in the gym. When I'm not inadvertently breaking our wonderful website I'm teetered to my computer playing videos games or programming an idea I had while pooping the other day.
