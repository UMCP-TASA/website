Hey guys! I’m Mandy and I’m a sophomore majoring in Communications on the Public Relations track. I love to crochet, watch tv, and romanticize my life ♡ I also LOVE Taiwan and visiting my friends and family there. Feel free to reach out about Night Market or literally anything else! I’m always online :)
