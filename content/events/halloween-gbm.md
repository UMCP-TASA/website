Hello! It is time for our annual collaboration event with FCA! Sadly this year, we are not able to hold Survive CP because of the ongoing COVID-19 Pandemic. But do not worry because in place of it, we will be doing virtual escape rooms!! I can guarantee you that it will be fun and it will be a great opportunity to meet new people! So do not forget to save the date. 10/26 @7pm, and we will see everyone there!!

Also there will be a RAFFLE at the end of the event with prizes of free boba and a gift card! What better way to spend your Monday night than with friends, fun, and free stuff? ![ðŸ¤©](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/images/emoji.php/v9/t58/1/16/1f929.png)

When: October 26 @7pm\
Where: ZOOM\
Who: EVERYONE
